Problem Statement : -

Build and submit a deep learning based Image classification model on 100 Images already scrapped during your previous assignment(for each category) + augmenting the training folder data from flipkart for the below categories :

1) Trousers (men) (100 images)

2) Jeans (men) (100 images)



Using the optimisers, callbacks and learning rates.

Use all the following optimisers:-

1) SGD + Momentum

2) Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent

3) RMSprop

4) Adam

5) Nadam



Train your model for each optimiser for 20 epochs and define all the callbacks (checkpoint, earlystopping, reducedLRonplateau) on your model and check its performance. Adjust the learning rates and observe the changes and display them into your notebook.
