Problem Statement :-

Build and submit a deep learning based Image classification model on 100 Images already scrapped during your previous assignment(for each category) + augmenting the training folder data from flipkart for the below categories :


1) Trousers (men) (100 images)
2) Jeans (men) (100 images)


Following augmentation techniques needs to be performed on all the images in your training dataset:
Rotation Range (-30,30)
Brightness (Increasing the brightness of the images once)
Brightness (Decreasing the brightness of the images once)
Flipping the images
Sharpening
